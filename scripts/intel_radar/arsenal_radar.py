"""Deep GitHub radar + objective distiller -- the eagle-eye's feed INTO the
SueAI council. Not a human-facing report.

WHY THIS EXISTS (founder, 2026-07-26): "our eagle eye is 10000-degree
short-sighted". Four repos he had to hand us MANUALLY, none of which the radar
had ever surfaced:

    yikart/AiToEarn                        24230 stars, topics=[auto-publish,
                                           douyin, xiaohongshu, kuaishou, ...]
    tashfeenahmed/freellmapi               16978 stars, topics=[]
    tmstack/awesome-persona-skills          3413 stars, topics=[]
    alchaincyf/zhangxuefeng-skill           9991 stars, topics=[]
    YouMind-OpenLab/ai-image-prompts-skill   528 stars, topics=[]

MEASURED ROOT CAUSE (probed against the live API on 2026-07-26, not guessed):
  1. FOUR OF THE FIVE CARRY NO TOPICS AT ALL. Every query in daily_report_v3
     (fetch_github_trending, fetch_github_freebies' topic half, and the whole
     blindspot radar) is `topic:`-driven, so those repos are not "ranked low",
     they are STRUCTURALLY INVISIBLE. Full-text `in:name` / `in:name,description`
     is therefore not a nice-to-have, it is the fix.
  2. `created:>7 days` in fetch_github_trending can only ever see brand-new
     repos. AiToEarn was created 2025-02-24. It could never appear.
  3. `per_page=50` + `sort=stars` buries the mid-star half of a result set. Two
     of the five sat inside the matched set and were cut off by the page size.
     per_page=100 is the same one request for double the coverage.
  4. `sort=stars` alone cannot see a small-but-moving repo. Mixing in
     `sort=updated` recovered ai-image-prompts-skill (528 stars).

  With those four corrections the scan plan below hits 5/5. Each query that
  proved a target is tagged `# PROVEN <repo>` and MUST NOT be "tidied away".

  5. THE PLAN ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH -- added 2026-07-27, founder: "it has to search
     Chinese and English, multilingual". The four fixes above are all about HOW
     we ask; this one is about WHAT LANGUAGE we ask in, and it is the same class
     of structural blindness. Until now every technical query was English, and
     the only CJK in the plan was domain vocabulary (medicine, classics). A tool
     named, described and documented in Chinese therefore could not be returned
     by any technical query we ran, no matter how popular it was -- measured:
     harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo, 99373 stars and squarely on our video line,
     had never once been surfaced. Its description is Chinese. The CJK technical
     block in scan_plan() is the fix, and it is not a translation of the English
     queries: the two halves return substantially different repos, which is the
     whole point of running both. Query wording IS the radar's eyesight, not
     configuration -- the same lesson as `stars:>100000` finding a 261k-star
     repo that every topic query missed.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO -- founder's correction, same day:
    "push it to SueAI, not to me ... free models, race, expert mechanism, they
     hold a discussion, decide what we actually need, then it comes to the CTO"
  So the distiller emits OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION AND CANDIDATE OPTIONS ONLY. No
  "should we adopt", no score, no cost rating, no recommendation. That judgement
  belongs to the council (scripts/council/). A radar that pre-decides leaves the
  council nothing to argue about, which is exactly the failure mode being fixed.

COST: zero. GitHub search is free; distillation runs on the council's internal
FREE model bench (scripts/council/llm_roster.py -- imported READ-ONLY, never
modified). No Cloudflare Workers AI, no GitHub Models, no xunfei MaaS chat.

# GitHub SEARCH is its own bucket and it is small: 10 req/min unauthenticated,
# 30 req/min authenticated. The rest of the REST API ("core") is 60/hr anon vs
# 5000/hr with a token. Everything below therefore goes through ONE throttled,
# budgeted, cached door -- a scan plan that grows by dimension must not be able
# to take the daily report down with it.
SEARCH_MIN_INTERVAL_AUTH = 2.2     # 60/2.2 = ~27 req/min, under the 30 ceiling
SEARCH_MIN_INTERVAL_ANON = 6.5     # 60/6.5 = ~9 req/min, under the 10 ceiling
# 34 -> 44 on 2026-07-27, when the CJK technical block took the plan from 27
# queries to 39. Raised rather than paid for by pruning, and the reasoning is
# worth keeping because "budget" reads like "cost" and here it is not:
#   * This budget is a RUNAWAY GUARD, not a quota. GitHub search costs nothing;
#     the ceiling that actually binds is 30 requests/MINUTE, and that is enforced
#     by SEARCH_MIN_INTERVAL_AUTH above (~27/min), not by this number. Raising
#     the budget cannot breach the rate limit -- it only buys wall time:
#     39 calls x 2.2s = ~86s, against ~59s for the old 27-query plan.
#   * 44 not 39, i.e. five spare, ON PURPOSE. When the budget is spent gh_search
#     returns empty and the plan is consumed IN ORDER, so a plan sized exactly to
#     its budget silently truncates from the TAIL -- and the tail is the CJK
#     block. Sizing it flush would have made the Chinese queries the first thing
#     to die on any future addition, which is the failure being fixed here.
# The env override stays the escape hatch if a run ever needs to be cut short.

        # ---- chinese ecosystem. Domain half (below) plus a TECHNICAL half that
        # did not exist before 2026-07-27: every technical query above this block
        # is English-only, so a project named, described and documented in
        # Chinese was structurally invisible for exactly the same reason the
        # original five were -- we were only ever asking in one language.
        #
        # THREE THINGS WERE MEASURED on 2026-07-27, all against the live API, and
        # they overturn the "CJK literals are best-effort" note that stood here:
        #
        #  1. `pushed:` IS THE CJK NOISE FILTER, and it is not optional. GitHub
        #     matches CJK loosely, so a handful of enormous, ABANDONED awesome
        #     lists sit at the top of nearly every CJK result set -- funNLP
        #     (82061 stars, no push in >90d) headed 11 of the 16 queries first
        #     tried. Adding `pushed:>d90` evicts them: `Q_ocr` went 93 results
        #     headed by funNLP -> 18 results that are all genuinely OCR. The
        #     filter buys precision, not freshness, which is why it is on almost
        #     every line below.
        #
        #  2. RESULT COUNT IS NOT QUALITY. The single highest-yielding CJK query
        #     tried, the classical-Chinese term for literary Chinese at
        #     `stars:>20`, returned 862 -- and was pure noise: rust-course and
        #     gpt_academic matched it. It is REJECTED despite out-yielding every
        #     query that was kept. Same verdict, same evidence standard, for the
        #     generic words for "skill" (107 results, all Android/admin/interview
        #     repos) and "workflow" (74, all Java ERP frameworks): a CJK word
        #     common in ordinary software prose cannot be a radar dimension.
        #
        #  3. `Q_tcmllm` DELIBERATELY CARRIES NO `pushed:` FILTER, and that is
        #     the one real exception to point 1. Measured both ways: without it,
        #     30 results led by ShenNong-TCM-LLM / TCMLLM / HuangDI; WITH
        #     `pushed:>d90`, 7 results whose stars are 3, 0, 0, 0, 0. The good
        #     work in this niche is finished research, not a live project, so
        #     here the freshness filter deletes precisely the rows we want.
        #     Do not "make it consistent" with the lines around it.
        #
        # Every query below was run against the live API on 2026-07-27 and is
        # tagged with what it actually returned. None was kept on taste; a query
        # that answers 0 is reported by --selftest and pruned, never left as
        # decoration. ----

    function sorted by (unseen, stars) and, because run 1 has an empty history,
    "unseen" was true for everything and the tiebreak collapsed to pure stars.

    every single line, i.e. 24 rows of zero signal. That is the same myopia
    wearing a different hat, and it is exactly what a report that only checked
    "did it run" would have shipped.

    The ordering that replaced it uses only hard facts about HOW a repo was
    found, never an opinion about the repo:
      * `query_breadth` -- how many results the query that found it returned.
        A repo found by a 1-result query (`topic:auto-publish` -> AiToEarn) is a
        targeted hit; the same repo appearing in a 100-result `awesome in:name`
        sweep is background. Narrowest match wins, decided in collect().
      * `position` -- its rank inside that query's own ordering.
      * `new_to_us` -- absent from our star history. Neutral on run 1 by
        construction, and correctly demotes repeats from run 2 on.
      * stars, last, purely to break exact ties.
